"settings-container", which was the name Angelina gave to it. Also Angelina's 20vh in the padding-top was copy-pasted into here to be together with
the whole code and I increased it to 25vh because of the navbar. Please, lemme know if it doesn't look so good in your computers! */

by putting all the settings with the same name - "setting". This section includes now the border below each line as well, so I don't need to be making
anymore of those:
<div className="border"></div>
<div className="smoker"></div>
<div className="border"></div>
<div className="vegetarian"></div>
It looked so ugly as it was, now it's looking much better *thumbs up* */

/* These two things above aren't here by chance. The radio toggles were set be dark blue when active by default, which didn't match our website's design, so
(and kudos to Elena for finding this out) we went to inspector to find the name given to the radio toggles so we could change their colour and we did it!
The first code is for a few seconds after the toggle is pressed, the second code is to change the color during the animation of pressing the toggle, so our
button can always be pink and stay pink the whole time */
